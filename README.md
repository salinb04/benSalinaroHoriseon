I have refactored the code of this website to be more concise and
logical to anyone viewing the index.html and style.css files. I 
reordered all the HTML and CSS elements in both files to follow
the order they appear on the page. I have also combined certain CSS
elements such as the float classes with the classes they affect to
save space. Redundant code was deleted and remaining code was consolidated
in the most efficient manner possible given my best judgment.
